In this setting, genetic characterization of the virus from geographically diverse patient samples is key to infer the rate of spread. However, as the virus reaches resource-limited settings such as Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar in proximity to the outbreak’s epicenter, there are basic challenges in sample collection, contact tracing, and surveillance that hinder disease containment, much less the ability to sequence new cases in-country. Implementing in-country sequencing and post-sequencing data analysis speeds up the time to answers, giving scientists in-country more ability to combat emerging infections.</p><h2>About</h2><p class="large-2KdbI">In a rapidly implemented response to the nCOV-2019 outbreak, the <b>CNM-NIAID</b> team and Institut Pasteur used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) and the IDseq bioinformatics platform to review the Cambodian index nCOV-2019 case and three sick family members, who had tested negative for nCOV-2019, in less than 48 hours from sample receipt.</p><p class="large-2KdbI">This project had 3 goals:</p><ol><li>Characterize the novel virus in addition to other potential pathogens circulating in the family cluster.</li><li>Investigate whether mNGS could reveal etiology for the 3 symptomatic PCR-negative family members.</li><li>Determine the full genomic sequence for immediate public use, comparing the sequence to existing published genomes around the world to understand global transmission patterns.</li></ol><h2>What hypothesis did the scientists have going in?</h2><ol><li>While RT-PCR confirmed the first positive case of the novel coronavirus in Cambodia, mNGS may provide additional sensitivity and reveal etiology for symptomatic, PCR-negative, family members.</li><li>Given the patient traveled directly from Wuhan to Cambodia on January 23, his virus should be phylogenetically similar to initial sequences published by Chinese researchers in Wuhan.</li></ol><h2>How was the data generated?</h2><p class="large-2KdbI">Institut Pasteur Cambodia conducted the RNA extraction from four nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) from the index case and three symptomatic family members. On February 1st, the <b>NIH-CNM</b> team made libraries from the extracted RNA, sequenced the samples on an iSeq100, demuxed the FASTQ files, and downloaded the results from Illumina’s Basespace. The data was then uploaded to IDseq and processed using the latest IDseq database - updated from NCBI on 2019-09-17. While the index did not contain the reference sequences for SARS-CoV-2, which were deposited to NCBI in January 2020, conclusions could still be drawn from the data. IDseq’s NCBI database index was updated on 2019-02-10 with the most recent version of NCBI that included the recently added SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The analysis was rerun using the new index to confirm the match to SARS-CoV-2 in the PCR-positive index case.</p><h2>What conclusions were drawn from the data?</h2><ol><li>SARS-CoV-2 was identified in the <a href="samples/41005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Index Case sample (Patient 1)</a>, confirming the PCR-positive results. Looking at the <a href="samples/41005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sample</a> and pipeline run with the most recent index you can see that IDseq picked up 1,237 reads that aligned to the genus Betacoronavirus (1,237 by NT, 1,173 by NR) with an average percent identity of 99.9% in NT. IDseq was able to generate 30 contigs from those reads with 45.9% coverage of NCBI accession sequence MN988558.1.</li><li>SARS-CoV-2 or similar pathogens were not found in any of the PCR-negative symptomatic family members (<a href="samples/41010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Member 1</a>, <a href="samples/41012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Member 2</a>, <a href="samples/41014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Family Member 3</a>) This means that the mNGS results align with the previously given PCR test.</li><li>In the symptomatic, but PCR-negative family members, IDseq <a href="visualizations/heatmap/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">identified several genera commonly associated with nasopharyngeal flora</a> at levels significantly greater than the water controls, generating hypotheses regarding the origin of the symptoms.</li><li>IDseq was able to successfully provide information on the presence of the novel coronavirus prior to the existence of full reference genomes in the NCBI database. The Index Case sample was run through the IDseq pipeline twice - first using an NCBI index that did not contain the new Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus and then again with an NCBI index that was generated in February 2020 that did contain the newly identified viral sequences. <a href="samples/41005?pipelineVersion=3.16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In the first case</a>, IDseq correctly picked up a divergent match with SARS-CoV (755 reads in NT and 854 reads in NR with an average percent identity of 91.5% and 88.8%, respectively). In the second case, IDseq correctly identified a match with the new SARS-CoV-2 reference (1,278 reads, at 99.9% identity to the reference sequence). These results indicate that even prior to the addition of the reference sequence to the database, IDseq demonstrated 93% read-level recall.</li></ol></div></div>
